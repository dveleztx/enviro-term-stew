# Terminal Environment Setup
*This stew sets up the linux environment (Pop OS/Ubuntu) to my preferences, including downloading packages I normally use*

## Instructions

This stew is designed to work with Ubuntu and Pop OS 20.04 and above. Many packages are not available pre-focal. Anything before that needs to be conditioned to work with your environment using something like snap packages. Possible update in the future.

### Automated Setup

This setup is relatively easy and straight forward, but running the **setup.sh** script will do all the legwork with no issues.

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Each script and playbook have descriptions on what they do so they can be maintained there.


### Completion

Once the execution for the setup script is complete, `exit` your shell and relaunch your terminal. Changes should now be now visible.
